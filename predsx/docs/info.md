## 1. Project Overview

**PredSX** is a production-grade, real-time prediction market data platform. It ingests live market data from Polymarket, normalizes and analyzes it for trading signals, and exposes it through a unified REST API and WebSocket gateway.

This repo is backend-only: a highly concurrent, event-driven system ("The Brain") built entirely in Go 1.23. The standalone Next.js frontend (PredSX-Stat) has been retired and removed from this stack.

**Entry Points:**
- **API Gateway** (Port `8088`): Unified REST API (`/v1/*`) with Redis-backed caching and rate limiting.
- **WebSocket Stream** (`/stream`): Live feed of trades, orderbook updates, prices, and signals.
- **CLI Tool** (`cmd/predsx`): Developer tool for querying market data from the terminal.
- **Health checks**: `http://localhost:<port>/health`
- **Metrics**: `http://localhost:<port>/metrics`

---

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack

The platform uses a **microservices architecture** managed via Go Workspaces (`go.work`). Originally 13 independent services, consolidated into **5 Core Hubs** to optimize for 4 GB RAM VPS constraints. All inter-service communication goes through Kafka — no direct HTTP calls between services.

| Technology | Role |
|---|---|
| Go 1.23 | Backbone language for all backend services |
| Apache Kafka | Central event bus |
| Redis | Caching, orderbook state, idempotency |
| ClickHouse | Time-series DB — 500 events/100ms batch inserts |
| PostgreSQL | Relational state (resumable backfill offsets) |
| Docker Compose | Local + production container orchestration |
| Kubernetes | Production deployment (k8s manifests included) |

**Data Flow:**
```
Polymarket WS / On-chain RPC
        │
        ▼
  Discovery Hub  →  Ingestion Hub  →  Processor Hub
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                       Storage Hub  →  ClickHouse
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                          API Hub  →  REST / WebSocket
```

---

## 3. Platform Services

The 5 Core Hubs live in `predsx/services/`:

| Hub | Merged From | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | `market-discovery`, `token-extractor` | Polls Polymarket Gamma API; extracts YES/NO token addresses with Redis idempotency |
| **Ingestion** | `stream`, `stream-aggregator`, `indexer` | Multi-connection WebSocket pool (FNV-1a consistent hashing); on-chain Polygon RPC with multi-endpoint failover |
| **Processor** | `trade-engine`, `orderbook-engine`, `price-engine`, `analyzer` | Real-time L2 orderbooks, mid-price/spread/volume calculations, trading signals |
| **Storage** | `normalizer`, `backfill` | Batch-flushes all raw events to ClickHouse; persists ingestion offsets to Postgres; historical backfill with resumable offsets |
| **API** | `api` | Unified REST gateway + WebSocket hub on port `8088` |

Each service is stateless. See [`api-reference.md`](api-reference.md) for full REST docs and [`rpc-failover-design.md`](rpc-failover-design.md) for ingestion failover details.

## 4. Quick Start — Docker Commands

Run all commands from the root `PredSX` folder (`C:\path\to\PredSX`).

### Start the Stack
```bash
docker compose -f predsx/deployments/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

### Stop the Stack
```bash
docker compose -f predsx/deployments/docker-compose.yml down
```
> Data is persisted safely in Docker volumes — `down` does not wipe the database.

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker compose -f predsx/deployments/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Single service
docker logs -f package-hub-ingestion-1
```

### Build a Single Service
```bash
docker build -t predsx-api -f predsx/services/api/Dockerfile .
```

> **Shortcut scripts**: `start-docker.bat` and `stop-docker.bat` in the project root wrap the commands above — double-click or run from any terminal.

---

## 5. Local Development (Windows/Mac)

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop installed and running.

```powershell
# 1. Open a terminal at the project root
# 2. Start all services
.\start-docker.bat

# 3. Verify the API is up
curl http://localhost:8088/health

# 4. Stop everything
.\stop-docker.bat
```

---

## 6. VPS Deployment (Ubuntu Linux)

**Prerequisites on VPS:** Docker Engine + Docker Compose V2, SSH access.

```bash
# 1. Transfer code (git clone or scp)
# 2. SSH in
ssh user@your-vps-ip

# 3. Navigate to project directory
cd ~/PredSX

# 4. Grant execute permissions
chmod +x deploy.sh

# 5. Start the stack
docker compose -f predsx/deployments/docker-compose.yml up --build -d

# 6. Monitor startup
docker compose -f predsx/deployments/docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

---

## 7. Developing with Docker

If you don't have `make` or `go` locally, Docker covers full development:

```powershell
# Start everything (from predsx/ subfolder)
docker-compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Build a single service image
docker build -t predsx-api -f services/api/Dockerfile .
```

---

## 8. VPS Storage & Logging Policy

To prevent 100% disk usage crashes (observed in earlier 48-hour VPS runs):

| Mechanism | Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Docker log rotation | Max 10 MB × 3 files per service | Caps container log disk use |
| Kafka retention | **7-day TTL** (`168h`), **512 MB max per partition**, 100 MB segment size | Transit pipe only — not for replay. Topic-level override on `predsx.ws.raw` keeps raw WS data to 24h / 300 MB per partition |
| Redis | In-memory only (`--save "" --appendonly no`), 64 MB cap, LRU eviction | Pure cache layer, no disk writes |
| ClickHouse TTL | See table below | Auto-purges stale partitions |

### ClickHouse Table TTLs

| Table | Retention | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `events_raw` | **3 days** | Raw WS payloads — high volume, short window |
| `trades` | **7 days** | Normalized trade events for recent analytics |
| `orderbook_history` | **2 days** | Snapshot history — highest write volume |
| `onchain_trades` | **14 days** | On-chain Polygon events |
| `market_metrics` | **2 days** | Aggregated per-market metrics |
| `market_metadata` | **permanent** | Market registry — never expires |
| `price_history_1m` | **30 days** | 1-minute OHLCV candles — high volume, short analytical window |
| `price_history_1h` | **90 days** | 1-hour OHLCV candles — longer retention for trend analysis |

TTLs are enforced by ClickHouse's `MergeTree` engine and applied automatically — no manual cleanup needed. TTL clauses are defined inline in `services/storage/main.go:ensureSchemas()`, not in `deployments/clickhouse/init.sql` (that file is a stale reference copy and is not mounted by Docker).

**Analytics note:** For model training, query `trades` or `price_history_1h` directly from ClickHouse via HTTP (`localhost:8123/play` locally, or via SSH tunnel on VPS). Do not rely on container logs.

---

## 9. Development Journey — Stage by Stage

### Stage 1 — Architecture Design & Project Scaffold

Key decisions:
- **Go Workspaces** (`go.work`) to manage multiple modules without duplicating dependencies.
- **Microservices architecture** — each service is an independently deployable binary.
- **Kafka** as the central event bus.
- **Monorepo layout**:
  ```
  PredSX/
  └── predsx/
      ├── libs/       ← Shared libraries
      ├── services/   ← Microservices
      ├── cmd/        ← CLI tool
      └── deployments/← Docker Compose + Kubernetes
  ```

**Result:** Clean, scalable skeleton with isolated `go.mod` per service, unified by `go.work`.

---

### Stage 2 — Shared Infrastructure Libraries

All shared client libraries built to production grade before any business logic:

| Library | Purpose | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| `libs/logger` | Structured logging | Interface + NoOpLogger for tests |
| `libs/config` | Env-var configuration | Required variable validation |
| `libs/retry-utils` | Retry with backoff | Exponential backoff for all I/O |
| `libs/kafka-client` | Kafka producer/consumer | Generics (`TypedProducer[T]`, `TypedConsumer[T]`) |
| `libs/redis-client` | Redis cache client | Pool size config |
| `libs/clickhouse-client` | ClickHouse time-series DB | `MaxOpenConns` + `ConnMaxLifetime` |
| `libs/postgres-client` | PostgreSQL client | `pgxpool` for high concurrency |
| `libs/websocket-client` | WebSocket connections | Standardized for ingestion & streaming |

A unified event schema system at `libs/schemas/` provides Protobuf definitions, Go structs with validation, JSON/Proto serialization helpers, and unit tests for all 8 platform event types.

---

### Stage 3 — Core Microservices Implementation

All 9 original microservices implemented end-to-end:

```
Polymarket API
      │
      ▼
[market-discovery] ──► predsx.markets.discovered
      │
[token-extractor]  ──► predsx.tokens.extracted
      │
[stream]           ──► Raw WebSocket events
      │
      ├──► [trade-engine]      ──► predsx.trades
      ├──► [orderbook-engine]  ──► predsx.orderbook
      └──► [price-engine]      ──► predsx.prices
                │
          [normalizer]         ──► ClickHouse (500 events / 100ms)
                │
             [api]             ──► REST / WebSocket (port 8080)
             [backfill]        ──► Historical data ingestion
```

**CLI Tool** (`cmd/predsx`): subcommands `markets`, `trades`, `orderbook`, `price`; rich table output via `tablewriter`; JSON pipe mode.

---

### Stage 4 — Package Name Conflict Fix

`libs/redis-client/redis.go` declared `package redis`, conflicting with `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`. Fixed by renaming the local package to `redisclient` across all consuming services.

---

### Stage 5 — Docker Build Optimization

**Problem:** Dockerfiles copied all `go.mod` files and ran `go work sync` for every service — multi-hour builds, network hangs, Docker Hub firewall blocks.

**Fix:** Rewrote all Dockerfiles to copy only the libs each service needs, disabled `go work sync`, set `GONOSUMDB=*`, and used the locally cached `golang:1.23-alpine` base image.

**Result:** Build times reduced from hours to minutes; Docker layer caching now effective.

---

### Stage 6 — Docker Build Error Fixes

Three classes of errors resolved:

1. **`ENV GOFLAGS=-mod=mod` incompatibility** with `go.work` — removed the `ENV` line; flags passed only at `go build` time.
2. **Missing `cmd/predsx` module** — `go.work` requires all referenced modules present; added `COPY cmd/predsx cmd/predsx` to all Dockerfiles.
3. **`go.sum` missing entries / rate limiting** — set `GOWORK=off` in Dockerfiles, copied root `go.work.sum` to each service's `go.sum`, used `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod` in the `go build` command.

---

### Stage 7 — Version Control Setup

- Git initialized at `C:/path/to/PredSX/`
- `.gitignore` covers binaries, `.env`, `vendor/`, IDE folders, Docker `.tar` artifacts, logs
- Initial commit: **72 files, 4023 insertions**

---

### Stage 8 — Production Gap Fixes & Database Integration

- **Redis Integration**: Replaced stub API data with live state fetches; persisted active orderbook to Redis.
- **ClickHouse**: Rigorous table schema init on startup + TTL strategy for raw event expiry.
- **Normalizer Scale-Out**: Worker pool for high-throughput Kafka-to-ClickHouse ingestion.

---

### Stage 9 — Real-Time WebSocket Gateway

- New `/stream` endpoint added to the `api` service.
- Internal WebSocket hub managing hundreds of concurrent client connections.
- Broadcast mechanism syncing Kafka stream payloads to all connected clients.

---

### Stage 10 — End-to-End Pipeline Hardening

- **Docker Build Stability**: Resolved `go.work` and module resolution edge cases.
- **End-to-End Data Flow**: Fixed upstream Polymarket `stream` connection bugs; verified pipeline from ingestion to WebSocket broadcast.
- **Developer Experience**: Added `start-docker.bat` / `stop-docker.bat` for frictionless local startup.

---

### Stage 11 — Hub Consolidation (5-Core Model)

After 48 hours on a 4 GB VPS, a storage crash prompted architectural consolidation from 13 services into the current 5 Core Hubs:

| Optimization | Impact |
|---|---|
| Hub consolidation | ~30% reduction in Docker RAM overhead |
| Storage bypass (Kafka + log rotation) | Eliminated 100% disk usage risk |
| Local build & ship (`.tar` transfer) | Bypassed Go compiler RAM spikes on VPS |

---

### Stage 12 — Pre-VPS Security & Stability Hardening

Before migrating to production VPS, a full audit identified and resolved two categories of issues.

**Phase 1 — Security:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Hardcoded Alchemy WSS key in `.env` | Removed; replaced with `POLYGON_RPC_URLS` free public pool |
| Dead RPC endpoints (`polygon-rpc.com`, `rpc.ankr.com`) in ingestion | Removed from `defaultRPCPool` |
| Infrastructure ports (`9092`, `6379`, `5432`, `8123`, `9000`) bound to `0.0.0.0` | Re-bound to `127.0.0.1` in dev compose |
| Kafka external listener port 9094 exposed unnecessarily | Port removed entirely |
| Gamma API pagination firing 30–50 requests/second | Added 200ms inter-page sleep → 5 req/s |
| `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (singular, dead) vs `POLYGON_RPC_URLS` (plural, actual) mismatch | Fixed env var name in both `.env` files and both compose files |

**Phase 2 — Stability:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| VPS: hub services started before Kafka was ready → crash loop | Added Kafka healthcheck; changed all hubs to `condition: service_healthy` |
| Kafka + Zookeeper had no named volumes → data lost on every restart | Added `kafka_data`, `zookeeper_data`, `zookeeper_log` volumes |
| Redis log rotation missing in VPS compose | Added `json-file` logging with 10 MB × 3 file cap |
| Redis disk persistence enabled on VPS (unnecessary writes) | Added `--save "" --appendonly no` |
| Zookeeper snapshots accumulating indefinitely | Added `AUTOPURGE_SNAP_RETAIN_COUNT=3` and `PURGE_INTERVAL=24` |

**Phase 3 — Pre-VPS Deploy:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| No `.dockerignore` — entire `predsx/` repo sent as Docker build context | Created `predsx/.dockerignore` excluding `docs/`, `deployments/`, `.git`, secrets |
| No TLS — API served over plain HTTP on port 8088 | Added `deployments/Caddyfile` + `docker-compose.caddy.yml` overlay for auto-HTTPS via Let's Encrypt |
| Hub healthchecks silently failing — `METRICS_PORT` defaulted to 8080 but checks called 8081–8084 | Added `METRICS_PORT=808x` to all 4 hub services in both compose files |
| Processor backtester port (8082) collided with ingestion metrics port (8082) | Changed processor `BACKTEST_PORT` to 8085 |

**Why `.dockerignore` matters:** Without it, the entire `predsx/` directory — including `docs/`, `deployments/`, `.git/`, and all Markdown files — is sent to the Docker daemon as the build context before each image build. This slows down every `docker build` call (network transfer to daemon) and risks accidentally including secrets or environment files inside images. The `.dockerignore` reduces the context to only what Go actually needs: `libs/`, `services/`, `cmd/`, `go.work`, `go.work.sum`.

**Why Caddy over Nginx:** Caddy handles Let's Encrypt TLS certificate issuance and renewal automatically with zero config — no certbot, no cron job. It is deployed as an optional overlay (`docker-compose.caddy.yml`) so you can run the stack without a domain (direct port 8088) and add TLS later by simply adding the overlay. When active, Caddy takes over port 80/443 and removes the public 8088 mapping from `hub-api`.

**Why METRICS_PORT was silent:** `service.BaseService` (in `libs/service/service.go`) starts an HTTP server on `METRICS_PORT` env var, defaulting to 8080. All 4 hub healthchecks in the VPS compose were calling ports 8081–8084 but the services were all listening on 8080. Every healthcheck was returning connection refused. Docker still ran the services (hub healthchecks are not used as dependency conditions), but `docker ps` showed every hub as `unhealthy`. Setting `METRICS_PORT=808x` per service costs zero code changes and fixes all four.

**Phase 4 — Cleanup:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `services/storage/main.go` had 15+ `fmt.Println`/`fmt.Printf` calls — no structured context, invisible to log aggregators | Replaced all with `svc.Logger.Info`/`svc.Logger.Error` (slog JSON); added `logger.Interface` parameter to `ensureSchemas` and `persistMarketMetadata` |
| `build-and-ship.bat` tagged all images `:latest` only — no way to roll back to a specific build | Now also tags each image `:<git-short-hash>`; rollback instructions printed after each build |

**Why structured logging matters on VPS:** The storage hub is the highest-write service — it handles ClickHouse schema init, batch inserts, and every market metadata save. With `fmt.Println`, all those messages were unstructured plain text with no timestamp, service name, or severity level, making them impossible to grep reliably or ship to a log aggregator. With `svc.Logger` (backed by Go's `log/slog` JSON handler), every line is a JSON object with `time`, `level`, `msg`, and any key-value fields. This makes `docker logs | grep '"level":"ERROR"'` work, and makes the storage hub's log output consistent with all other hubs which already used `svc.Logger`.

**Why git hash tagging matters:** Every `build-and-ship.bat` run previously overwrote `:latest` on all 5 images with no record of what changed. If a deploy broke something, there was no prior image to roll back to — you'd have to rebuild from source on VPS. Now each build also tags `:<short-hash>` (e.g. `predsx-api:fc0dd1c`). The `:latest` tag still advances as normal, but the hash tag is permanent. Rolling back is: stop the stack, change image tags in `docker-compose.yml` to the old hash, bring the stack back up.

See [`port-security.md`](port-security.md) for the full networking, port binding, and TLS documentation. See [`storage-projections.md`](storage-projections.md) for disk and RAM capacity planning.

---

### Stage 14 — API Security Hardening

After first VPS deploy, a full security audit of `hub-api` identified six production-grade gaps. All fixes live in `services/api/`.

---

**SecurityHeaders Middleware**

Added `middleware/security.go` — injects 5 headers on every HTTP response:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME-type sniffing in browsers |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Blocks clickjacking via iframe embedding |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | `1; mode=block` | Enables XSS filter in older browsers |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Limits referer header leakage |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'` | Disallows all resource loading (API-only, no HTML) |

Middleware is registered globally in `main.go` — all routes including `/health` and `/v1/*` get these headers automatically.

---

**CORS Allowlist**

Replaced wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with an env-var-driven allowlist in `middleware/cors.go`.

- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated) — defaults to `http://localhost:3000`
- Requests from unlisted origins receive no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (effectively blocked by browser)
- `Vary: Origin` header added so CDN/proxies cache per-origin correctly
- Only `GET` and `OPTIONS` methods allowed

**Why this matters:** A wildcard CORS origin allows any website to make credentialed requests to your API from a user's browser. Since this API exposes live market data and will eventually handle wallet-linked positions, locking origins to known domains prevents third-party sites from silently scraping or acting on behalf of users.

---

**Trusted Proxies for Rate Limiting**

Added `TRUSTED_PROXIES` env var to `middleware/ratelimit.go`. When set to a CIDR or IP, the rate limiter reads the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` only if the request originates from a trusted proxy. When unset, `RemoteAddr` is always used directly.

**Why this matters:** Without trusted proxy awareness, an attacker can send `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4` from any IP and effectively bypass per-IP rate limits by rotating the header value. The TRUSTED_PROXIES guard means spoofed `X-Forwarded-For` headers from untrusted sources are ignored.

`Retry-After: 60` header added to all `429` responses so clients know exactly when to retry.

---

**Internal Error Masking**

Seven handler locations in `rest.go` that previously returned raw database errors to clients (e.g. `clickhouse: code 60, ClickHouse exception`) were updated to:
1. Log the full internal error with `svc.Logger.Error(..., "error", err)`
2. Return a generic `"internal server error"` string to the client

**Why this matters:** Raw ClickHouse and Redis error messages expose internal hostnames, table names, schema details, and query structure. This information directly helps an attacker understand your infrastructure layout.

---

**HTTP Server Hardening**

Two fields added to `http.Server` in `main.go`:

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `IdleTimeout` | `60s` | Closes keep-alive connections idle for >60s — prevents connection exhaustion |
| `MaxHeaderBytes` | `65536` (64KB) | Rejects requests with oversized headers — prevents header-based DoS |

---

**`/metrics` Gated Behind Debug Token**

`/metrics` (Prometheus scrape endpoint) was previously public — anyone could query it and learn service internals (Goroutine counts, memory usage, open connections, latency histograms). It now requires the same `X-Debug-Token` / `?debug_token` auth as `/debug/*` routes.

Returns `403 debug endpoints disabled` if `DEBUG_TOKEN` is not set in the environment.

---

### Stage 15 — Parallel Event Discovery

**Problem:** `event_id` was empty on the majority of markets returned from `/v1/markets/{id}/related`. The endpoint always returned `[]`.

**Root cause — two layers:**

1. The Gamma `/markets` endpoint (used by `discoverMarkets`) omits `eventId` on many markets — it is populated inconsistently depending on whether Polymarket includes it in the market-level JSON.
2. `discoverMarkets` and `discoverEvents` were running **sequentially** — discovery crawled all active markets first (~3.5 minutes per 100 markets due to 200ms paging sleep), and only then started event discovery. On a large dataset this meant `discoverEvents` didn't start for 30–60+ minutes after boot.

**How `discoverEvents` works:**

The Gamma `/events` endpoint returns event objects that each contain a `markets` array. Every market nested under an event is guaranteed to have the parent's event ID. `discoverEvents` paginates `/events`, iterates the nested markets, and explicitly sets `m.EventID = ev.ID` if the market-level field is empty — guaranteeing `event_id` is always populated before publishing to Kafka.

```
Gamma /events
  └── event { id: "30615", markets: [ market_A, market_B, market_C ] }
        └── each market published with event_id = "30615"
```

**Fix — parallel execution with `sync.WaitGroup`:**

Both discovery loops now start simultaneously inside a `runBoth()` closure:

```go
runBoth := func(label string) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(2)
    go func() { defer wg.Done(); discoverMarkets(...) }()
    go func() { defer wg.Done(); discoverEvents(...) }()
    wg.Wait()
}
runBoth("initial discovery")   // on startup
for { select { case <-ticker.C: runBoth("discovery cycle") } }
```

`discoverMarkets` and `discoverEvents` run concurrently. Each paginates its own endpoint independently. `wg.Wait()` ensures both complete before the next tick fires. There is no shared mutable state between the two goroutines — each only reads its own pagination cursor and publishes to its own Kafka producer reference.

**Result:** `event_id` is populated within the first poll cycle (~60s) instead of after the full markets crawl. `/related` returns siblings for multi-outcome event groups immediately after the first boot cycle completes.

**New env var:** `GAMMA_EVENTS_URL` (default: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events`) — allows overriding the events endpoint for testing or if Polymarket changes the URL.

---

### Stage 13 — VPS First Deploy: Production Bug Fixes

After the first real VPS deploy, two bugs surfaced that only appeared with live Polymarket data.

---

**Bug 1 — `/v1/markets?status=ACTIVE` returned `{"data":[]}`**

Root cause: `PolymarketMarket` struct in `services/discovery/main.go` had `Status string \`json:"status"\`` but the Polymarket Gamma API returns boolean fields (`active`, `closed`, `resolved`), not a string `status`. The field always deserialized as `""`. Storage wrote all markets to ClickHouse with empty `status`. The API query uses `WHERE LOWER(status) = LOWER(?)`, so filtering for `ACTIVE` returned zero rows.

Fix:
- Added `Active bool \`json:"active"\``, `Closed bool \`json:"closed"\``, `Resolved bool \`json:"resolved"\`` to `PolymarketMarket`
- Added `DerivedStatus()` method that maps booleans → `"ACTIVE"` / `"CLOSED"` / `"RESOLVED"` / `"UNKNOWN"`, with fallback to the string field if present
- Changed event construction to use `Status: m.DerivedStatus()`

After deploying the fixed discovery image (`docker compose up -d --no-deps hub-discovery`), new rows appeared in ClickHouse with correct status within one poll cycle (~60s).

---

**Bug 2 — `/v1/markets/{id}/price` returned `"price not found"` for all markets**

Root cause: key mismatch between writer and reader.
- Processor hub writes to Redis key: `live:price:<marketID>`
- API `GetPrice` handler read from: `predsx:price:<marketID>`

Fix: Changed `rest.go` line 333 from `predsx:price:` to `live:price:`.

---

**Operational lessons learned:**

| Lesson | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `docker save >` corrupts tar files | PowerShell `>` writes UTF-16 with BOM. Always use `docker save -o file.tar` |
| `docker compose restart` does not load new images | It restarts the existing container. Use `docker compose up -d --no-deps <service>` to recreate with a newly loaded image |
| ClickHouse database is `default`, not `predsx` | All tables live in `default`. Queries must use `default.market_metadata` etc. |
| Container prefix is `package-*`, not `predsx-*` | Docker uses the compose file's directory name (`package`) as the project prefix |

---

### Stage 16 — VPS Disk Spike: Kafka + ClickHouse Cleanup

A disk usage alert fired at 83% (swap 53%) roughly 4 weeks after first VPS deploy. Root causes and fixes:

**Cause 1 — Kafka `predsx.ws.raw` topic grew to 7.5 GB (no per-topic limits)**

The global `KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_BYTES` of 1 GB applied per *partition*. With 6 partitions, ws.raw alone could hold 6 GB before eviction. Raw WebSocket payloads have no replay value; the topic is a transit pipe only.

Fix: Set topic-level overrides at runtime + made them permanent in `docker-compose.yml`:
```bash
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter \
  --topic predsx.ws.raw \
  --config retention.ms=86400000 \
  --config retention.bytes=314572800 \
  --config segment.bytes=104857600
```
Also updated broker-level defaults in compose:
```yaml
KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS: 168       # was: 2 (applied per partition, too permissive)
KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_BYTES: 536870912 # 512 MB per partition
KAFKA_LOG_SEGMENT_BYTES: 104857600   # 100 MB — allows earlier cleanup
```

**Cause 2 — ClickHouse 6.4 GB of orphaned store directories**

Every time a ClickHouse table is dropped and recreated, the old data directory (named by UUID) is left on disk. ClickHouse does not auto-delete these. Over time, dropping/recreating tables during development left 6.4 GB of unreferenced UUID directories under `/var/lib/clickhouse/store/`.

These directories also loaded into ClickHouse memory on startup, pushing RSS to 1.31–1.48 GB against a 1.5 GB container limit — causing intermittent OOM restarts.

Fix:
1. Stop ClickHouse container
2. Mount the volume with Alpine: `docker run --rm -it -v package_clickhouse_data:/data alpine sh`
3. List tables that actually exist in metadata: `ls /data/metadata/default/`
4. Compare against `ls /data/store/` — any UUID subdir not referenced by a live table is orphaned
5. Delete orphaned dirs: `rm -rf /data/store/<uuid>/`
6. Restart ClickHouse — RSS dropped to ~200 MB, all OOM restarts stopped

After cleanup: ClickHouse store went from 6.7 GB → 193 MB. Total disk dropped from 83% → 41%.

**Cause 3 — `price_history_1m` and `price_history_1h` had no TTL**

These tables accumulated candles indefinitely. Added TTL in `services/storage/main.go`:
- `price_history_1m`: 30-day TTL
- `price_history_1h`: 90-day TTL

TTL runs during background MergeTree merges — no manual cleanup needed. Do not run `OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL` on these tables on a low-RAM VPS; it triggers an in-memory merge of all parts and will OOM.

### Stage 17 — Tags & Category Pipeline Fix

`/v1/categories` and `/v1/tags` returned `[]` despite 112k+ rows in `market_metadata`.

**Root cause:** Polymarket Gamma API returns `"tags": null` on individual market objects. The discovery service was using `m.Tags` (the market-level field) for both paths — `extractTagSlugs(m.Tags)` and `extractCategory(m.Tags)` — which always produced nil/empty.

Tags exist at the **event level** (the parent `PolymarketEvent`), not on sub-markets. The `PolymarketEvent` struct was missing a `Tags` field entirely, so event-level tags were never captured.

**Fix in `services/discovery/main.go`:**

1. Added `Tags []PolymarketTag \`json:"tags"\`` to `PolymarketEvent` struct
2. In `discoverEvents`, fall back to `ev.Tags` when `m.Tags` is empty:

```go
effectiveTags := m.Tags
if len(effectiveTags) == 0 {
    effectiveTags = ev.Tags
}
event := schemas.MarketDiscovered{
    ...
    Tags:     extractTagSlugs(effectiveTags),
    Category: extractCategory(effectiveTags),
    ...
}
```

After one discovery cycle (~60 seconds), `market_metadata` rows began populating with real categories (`politics`, `world`, `pop-culture`, etc.) and tags. Both endpoints now return data.

**Note:** Markets discovered via `discoverMarkets` (the flat `/markets` endpoint) still have no tags if Polymarket returns `null` there. Only event sub-markets benefit from this fallback. `series` was always populated correctly from `groupItemTitle`.

---

### Stage 18 — Interactive API Docs (Scalar)

Added a live, interactive API documentation page served directly from `hub-api` with no new containers or services.

**What was added:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `services/api/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec covering all 28 endpoints — paths, parameters, request/response schemas, security schemes |
| `services/api/main.go` | Two new routes: `GET /openapi.json` and `GET /docs` |

**How `/docs` works:**

1. Browser hits `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8088/docs`
2. `hub-api` returns a 6-line HTML page (inlined in `main.go`)
3. Browser loads Scalar UI from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` (external CDN — fetched by the browser, not the VPS)
4. Scalar fetches `/openapi.json` from `hub-api` and renders the full interactive docs

```
hub-api container (port 8088)
├── /v1/*           → API endpoints
├── /openapi.json   ← spec embedded in binary via //go:embed
└── /docs           ← HTML page that loads Scalar from CDN
```

**The `openapi.json` is embedded in the binary** using Go's `//go:embed` directive — no extra files needed at runtime, no volume mounts. Updating the spec requires rebuilding and redeploying `hub-api`.

**CSP fix:** The global `SecurityHeaders` middleware sets `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` on all responses. The `/docs` handler overrides this header before writing the response to allow loading scripts/styles from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` only. All other routes remain under the strict `default-src 'none'` policy.

**Scalar is free** — MIT licensed, open source. No account or API key required. It is loaded from CDN at page-render time; the VPS does not need outbound internet access for the docs to be served (only the user's browser does).

**Features:**
- "Try it out" button on every endpoint — makes real HTTP requests to the API
- Authorize button for `X-Debug-Token` (persisted across page reloads)
- All query parameters, path params, and response schemas documented

### Stage 19 — `market_metadata` Deduplication (ReplacingMergeTree)

**Problem:** `market_metadata` used `MergeTree() ORDER BY (market_id, created_at)`. The discovery service re-inserts every active market every 60 seconds. With `MergeTree`, each insert creates a new row — there is no deduplication. After weeks of operation: 116k rows for only 46k unique markets (2.5× bloat), growing at ~2k rows/minute indefinitely.

**Why this matters:**
- Table scan cost grows linearly with duplicate rows — queries get slower over time
- Disk fills up from metadata rows alone
- API responses could return stale/duplicate data for the same market

**Fix — two parts:**

**Part 1: Change table engine in `services/storage/main.go`**

```go
// Before
ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY (market_id, created_at)

// After
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(created_at) ORDER BY market_id
```

`ReplacingMergeTree(created_at)` deduplicates rows with the same `market_id` during background merges, keeping the row with the latest `created_at`. The `ORDER BY` is changed to just `market_id` because that is the unique key — including `created_at` in the sort key would prevent deduplication.

**Part 2: Add `FINAL` to all API queries on `market_metadata` in `services/api/handlers/rest.go`**

`FINAL` deduplicates at query time regardless of whether a background merge has run yet:
```sql
-- Before
FROM market_metadata WHERE market_id = ?

-- After
FROM market_metadata FINAL WHERE market_id = ?
```

Applied to: market listing, filtered markets, single market lookup, search, related markets.
Category/tag/series queries already used `count(DISTINCT market_id)` so they were correct even with duplicates.

**VPS migration (ClickHouse does not support ALTER TABLE to change engine):**

```sql
-- 1. Rename old table (keeps data safe)
RENAME TABLE market_metadata TO market_metadata_old;

-- 2. Create new table with correct engine
CREATE TABLE market_metadata (...) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(created_at) ORDER BY market_id;

-- 3. Insert only the latest row per market_id (deduplicated)
INSERT INTO market_metadata
SELECT * FROM market_metadata_old
WHERE (market_id, created_at) IN (
    SELECT market_id, max(created_at) FROM market_metadata_old GROUP BY market_id
);

-- 4. Verify: rows should equal unique_markets
SELECT count() as rows, uniq(market_id) as unique_markets FROM market_metadata;
-- Result: 46893  46893  ✅

-- 5. Drop old table
DROP TABLE market_metadata_old;
```

**Result:** 116k rows → 46k rows (70k duplicates removed). Table now stays near 1:1 ratio — background merges keep it clean, `FINAL` guarantees correct reads in between.

### Stage 20 — Uptime Kuma Status Dashboard

**Problem:** No visual way to see which services are up/down, no response-time history, no public status page.

**Solution:** Added `louislam/uptime-kuma:1` as a dedicated Docker container in `docker-compose.yml`. It runs on port `3001`, uses a named volume (`uptime_kuma_data`) for SQLite persistence, and monitors all 12 internal endpoints directly by Docker service name — no public IP hops.

**Files changed:**

- `predsx/deployments/package/docker-compose.yml` — new `uptime-kuma` service block + `uptime_kuma_data` volume
- `predsx/docs/uptime-kuma.md` — new doc: full setup guide, all 12 monitor configs, Discord alert setup, status page creation, maintenance commands

**12 monitors configured:**

| Group | Monitors |
|---|---|
| Infrastructure (TCP) | `clickhouse:9000`, `redis:6379`, `kafka:9092`, `postgres:5432` |
| Service health (HTTP `/health`) | `hub-api:8088`, `hub-discovery:8081`, `hub-ingestion:8082`, `hub-processor:8083`, `hub-storage:8084` |
| API endpoints (HTTP) | `/v1/markets`, `/v1/categories`, `/v1/tags` |

**Resource cost:** ~60–80 MB RAM, ~50–100 MB disk/year — negligible on the VPS.

**Relationship with existing cron monitoring:**

| System | Covers |
|---|---|
| Cron script (`predsx-health.sh`) | OS-level: disk %, RAM %, swap %, exited containers |
| Uptime Kuma | Per-service: HTTP status, TCP connectivity, response-time graphs, public status page |

Both run independently — they are complementary, not redundant.

**Access:** `http://167.233.97.217:3001` (admin login set on first visit)
