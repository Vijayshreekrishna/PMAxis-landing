# PMAxis — ClickHouse Query Guide

> SQL reference for querying PMAxis data directly from ClickHouse.
> Useful for debugging, analytics, and building ML/signal features.

All tables live in the **`default`** database. All timestamps are stored as `DateTime64(3)` (millisecond precision) or `DateTime`.

SELECT trade_id, market_id, price, size, side, timestamp
FROM default.trades
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Recent trades for a specific market

    market_id,
    count() AS trade_count,
    sum(size) AS total_volume,
    avg(price) AS avg_price
FROM default.trades
WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY market_id
ORDER BY total_volume DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Price range for a market over last 24 hours

SELECT
    min(price) AS low,
    max(price) AS high,
    avg(price) AS avg,
    argMin(price, timestamp) AS open,

## On-Chain Trades

> **Important:** `onchain_trades.amount` is stored as `String` (raw ERC-1155 token units,
> not normalized). Always use `toFloat64OrZero(amount)` in aggregations, and divide by
> `1000000` to convert to USDC. Example: `14595690799951` raw = ~$14.6M USDC.

### Recent on-chain trade events
```sql
SELECT tx_hash, maker, taker, token_id, amount, timestamp
FROM default.onchain_trades
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### On-chain volume by token (last 24 hours)
```sql
SELECT
    token_id,
    count() AS tx_count,
    sum(toFloat64OrZero(amount)) / 1e6 AS onchain_volume_usdc
FROM default.onchain_trades
WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY token_id
ORDER BY onchain_volume_usdc DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Top wallets by on-chain trading volume (all time)
```sql
SELECT
    maker AS wallet,
    count() AS trade_count,
    sum(toFloat64OrZero(amount)) / 1e6 AS volume_usdc
FROM default.onchain_trades
GROUP BY maker
ORDER BY trade_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

> **Note:** The top addresses by count are Polymarket's own AMM bots. Retail wallet
> `0xE111180000d2663C0091e4f400237545B87B996B` is the most active non-bot address
> with ~147K trades. `0xAdA100Db00Ca00073811820692005400218FcE1f` has confirmed
> open positions data via the Polymarket Data API.

### On-chain history for a specific wallet
```sql
-- Replace the address with any 0x wallet
SELECT tx_hash, maker, taker, token_id,
       toFloat64OrZero(amount) / 1e6 AS amount_usdc,
       if(lower(maker) = '0xe111180000d2663c0091e4f400237545b87b996b', 'sell', 'buy') AS side,
       timestamp
FROM default.onchain_trades
WHERE lower(maker) = '0xe111180000d2663c0091e4f400237545b87b996b'
   OR lower(taker) = '0xe111180000d2663c0091e4f400237545b87b996b'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Wallet activity summary (watched wallets — wallet_activity table)
```sql
SELECT
    wallet,
    count()                AS total_trades,
    sum(amount) / 1e6      AS total_volume_usdc,
    countIf(side='buy')    AS buys,
    countIf(side='sell')   AS sells,
    min(timestamp)         AS first_seen,
    max(timestamp)         AS last_seen
FROM default.wallet_activity
GROUP BY wallet
ORDER BY total_trades DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Storage & System

### Table sizes on disk
```sql
SELECT
    table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) AS size,
    count() AS parts,
    sum(rows) AS row_count
FROM system.parts
WHERE active AND database = 'default'
GROUP BY table
ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC;
```

### Check TTL settings for each table
```sql
SELECT name, engine, ttl
FROM system.tables
WHERE database = 'default'
ORDER BY name;
```

### Check row counts for all tables
```sql
SELECT
    table,
    sum(rows) AS total_rows
FROM system.parts
WHERE active AND database = 'default'
GROUP BY table
ORDER BY total_rows DESC;
```

### Current active merges (check if background work is happening)
```sql
SELECT table, elapsed, progress, rows_read, rows_written
FROM system.merges
WHERE database = 'default';
```

## ML / Analytics Patterns

### Build a feature dataset: price + volume per 5-minute bucket
```sql
SELECT
    toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE) AS bucket,
    market_id,
    sum(volume) AS volume_5m,
    sum(trade_count) AS trades_5m,
    avg(close) AS avg_close,
    max(high) - min(low) AS price_range_5m
FROM default.price_history_1m
WHERE market_id = '558935'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY bucket, market_id
ORDER BY bucket ASC;
```

### Price momentum — compare last 1h vs previous 1h
```sql
WITH
    recent AS (
        SELECT avg(close) AS price
        FROM default.price_history_1h
        WHERE market_id = '558935'
          AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    ),
    previous AS (
        SELECT avg(close) AS price
        FROM default.price_history_1h
        WHERE market_id = '558935'
          AND timestamp BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR AND now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    )
SELECT
    recent.price AS recent_price,
    previous.price AS prev_price,
    round((recent.price - previous.price) / previous.price * 100, 2) AS pct_change
FROM recent, previous;
```

### Find markets with unusual volume spike (>3x their 7-day average)
```sql
WITH avg_vol AS (
    SELECT market_id, avg(volume) AS avg_1h_volume
    FROM default.price_history_1h
    WHERE timestamp BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY AND now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    GROUP BY market_id
),
recent_vol AS (
    SELECT market_id, sum(volume) AS last_1h_volume
    FROM default.price_history_1h
    WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    GROUP BY market_id
)
SELECT
    r.market_id,
    r.last_1h_volume,
    a.avg_1h_volume,
    round(r.last_1h_volume / a.avg_1h_volume, 2) AS volume_ratio
FROM recent_vol r
JOIN avg_vol a ON r.market_id = a.market_id
WHERE r.last_1h_volume > a.avg_1h_volume * 3
ORDER BY volume_ratio DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Export market candles to CSV (for Python/pandas)
```bash
docker exec -it package-clickhouse-1 clickhouse-client \
  --query "SELECT timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume FROM default.price_history_1m WHERE market_id = '558935' ORDER BY timestamp ASC FORMAT CSV" \
  > market_558935_candles.csv
```
