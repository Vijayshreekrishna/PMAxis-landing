# 🍳 PMAxis: The Master Recipe for Future Growth

This "recipe" outlines the strategic roadmap for evolving PMAxis into a world-class trading platform. Each "Dish" represents a major feature set and its implementation plan.

---

### 🥗 Dish No. 1: Strategy Backtesting
**Goal:** Prove your strategies work before risking real capital.
*   **Ingredients:** ClickHouse (Historical Data), Analyzer (Logic), Python/Go Backtest Runner.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  Create a `backtest-service` that queries ClickHouse for a specific time range (e.g., "Last 30 Days").
    2.  Pipe the historical trades through the `analyzer` as if they were happening live.
    3.  Calculate the hypothetical PnL (Profit and Loss) based on signal accuracy.
    4.  Visualize results on a "Backtest Dashboard" in the frontend.

### 🥩 Dish No. 2: ML Signal Refinement
**Goal:** Move from hardcoded logic to intelligent, adaptive predictions.
*   **Ingredients:** Scikit-learn/XGBoost, ClickHouse, ONNX Runtime (for Go).
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Feature Engineering:** Extract orderbook imbalance, trade velocity, and spread volatility from ClickHouse.
    2.  **Labeling:** Mark "Success" as any signal where price moved favorably in the next 5 minutes.
    3.  **Training:** Train a classification model to output a probability score (0.0 to 1.0).
    4.  **Inference:** Integrate the model into the Go `analyzer` service to filter out low-confidence signals.

### 🌶️ Dish No. 3: Automated Execution & Multi-Exchange Support
**Goal:** The "Holy Grail" – auto-trading across multiple platforms.
*   **Ingredients:** Polymarket CLOB SDK, Kalshi/PredictIt APIs, Kafka.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Execution Engine:** Create a service that consumes `High Severity` signals and signs transactions via Polymarket’s API.
    2.  **Multi-Exchange:** Add new discovery services (`kalshi-discovery`, `predictit-stream`) that normalize data into your internal Kafka format.
    3.  **Arbitrage Logic:** Compare prices across exchanges in the `analyzer` to spot cross-platform price gaps.

### 🍛 Dish No. 4: Portfolio Management & Social Alerts
**Goal:** Track your wins and stay notified on the go.
*   **Ingredients:** Postgres (Positions), Telegram Bot API, Discord Webhooks.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Portfolio View:** Add a "Wallet" page to **PMAxis-Stat** showing open positions, total equity, and daily PnL.
    2.  **Social Service:** Build a `notification-service` that listens to Kafka and sends high-value alerts (e.g., "Arbitrage Opportunity!") directly to your Telegram or Discord.

### 🍰 Dish No. 5: The "Auth Layer" & PMAxis Companion
**Goal:** Secure the platform and take it mobile.
*   **Ingredients:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), React Native, Biometrics API.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Auth Layer:** Implement a Go middleware in the `api` service to verify JWT tokens on every request. Add a `/login` endpoint.
    2.  **PMAxis Companion (Mobile):** 
        *   **The Tech:** Use React Native to share 50% of the web code (API logic/Stores).
        *   **The Goal:** A native app with **Biometric Login** (FaceID/Fingerprint) and **Push Notifications** for real-time trade alerts.

### 🐋 Dish No. 6: True Whale Tracking (On-Chain Indexing)
**Goal:** Identify major market players and track their specific wallet movements in real-time.
*   **Ingredients:** Polygon RPC nodes, Go-Ethereum (Geth), Smart Contract ABIs.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **On-Chain Listener:** Build an `indexer-service` that listens directly to Polygon block events for Polymarket's CTF (Conditional Token Framework) contract.
    2.  **Wallet Mapping:** Extract the `maker` and `taker` addresses from the raw transaction logs and correlate them with the CLOB trade events.
    3.  **Whale Alerts:** Emit a `whale_alert` signal to Kafka when a known large wallet (or a trade over a massive USD threshold) enters a position.

### 🎮 Dish No. 7: Virtual Paper Trading & Copytrade Simulator
**Goal:** Practice trading and test whale-following strategies with zero risk.
*   **Ingredients:** Redis (Virtual Balances), Processor (Copy Logic), Postgres (Trade History).
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Shadow Engine:** Extend the `Processor-Hub` to listen for trades from your "Whale Watchlist."
    2.  **Auto-Execute:** When a watched whale buys, the system automatically creates a "Mirror Trade" in a virtual database for your account.
    3.  **Real-time PnL:** Use the live price feed to update your virtual profit/loss instantly, just like a real exchange.

### 🏆 Dish No. 8: The Alpha Leaderboard (Social Insight)
**Goal:** Rank every wallet on Polymarket by profitability to find the best traders to follow.
*   **Ingredients:** ClickHouse (Historical Trades), SQL Window Functions, Frontend Tables.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Profit Calculation:** Run a ClickHouse query that aggregates every trade for a specific wallet to calculate its total ROI (Return on Investment).
    2.  **The Leaderboard:** Create an API endpoint `/v1/leaderboard` that returns the top 50 most profitable wallets.
    3.  **Follow Button:** In the UI, allow the user to click "Follow" on a leader to add them to their automated Copytrade Simulator (Dish No. 7).
